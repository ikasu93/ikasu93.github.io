									</header>
									<a href="images/threejs.png" class="image fit"><img src="images/threejs.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In my bachelor thesis I developed a 3D visualization of a car model and a simple world for browser applications. Furthermore, a <a href= "http://www.monticore.de/languages/montiarc/">MontiArc</a> controller for autonomous driving was designed and an API between the visualization, the controller and the server was implemented with Java.</p>
									<p><div><details><summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
<div align="justify" style="margin-top: 12px;">In the current, self-driving cars are a huge topic especially because
quality and safety are important factors for humanity. The mortality caused by traffic accidents due to human errors is relatively high.
Research topics revolving around autonomous driving and the technology involved with it have made their appearance, as it has gained in
importance but also in complexity.
<br> </br>
The 3D visualization of research progress is useful so that the software, which controls the autonomous car, can be simulated and tested
in graphical form before using it in a real life scenario. This project deals with the 3D visualization of self-driving cars in web
browsers. The graphical representation of the car behavior helps to
better understand the mechanism of the controller and offers a visual
overview about it. Besides the visualization of the car, it also tackles
the question on how to remotely control a car rendered in a browser.<br></br>

										<h2 id="Guide20">An ethics guideline for data scientists (2020)</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="images/concept_overview2.jpg" class="image fit"><img src="images/concept_overview2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>As part of my master thesis I have designed a guideline for data scientist to identify and be aware of biases in the data science lifecycle. The guideline is implemented as <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> extension with JavaScript and Python. In addition, features were integrated, which allow tagging and autocompletion.</p>
									<p><div><details><summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
<div align="justify" style="margin-top: 12px;">In recent years, data science has become an indispensable part of our society. Over time, we have become reliant on this technology because of its opportunity to gain
value and new insights from data in any field - business, socializing, research and society. The first phase of data science focused on the accuracy and efficiency of
data and its algorithms. The second phase is now based on the growing dependency - due to convergence of big data, cloud computing, the use of new technologies, such
as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning algorithms, which allows automation for some tasks with better performance than humans. At the same time, it raises
questions about how justified we are in placing our trust in these technologies. There is a risk that such powers may lead to biased, inappropriate or unintended
actions. Automated decisions by AI may not be transparent and unfair towards certain groups. Each step in the data science process (from raw data to insight
and knowledge retrieval) may create bias. Therefore, ethical considerations which might occur as the result of data science practices should be carefully considered
and these potential problems should be identified during the data science lifecycle and mitigated if possible.
<br></br>
This leads to the area of responsible data science (<a href="https://redasci.org/">RDS</a>).
Aspects of RDS centers around data ethics, e.g. achieving fair, consensual, transparent
data which shall provide clarity to data science algorithms. There are some
tools towards data ethics, e.g. ethical codes by the ACM, the IEEE and the ASA
that address data. But these theories have to be embedded in practical approaches.
Although various researchers have raised ethical concerns in AI, there have been
very few studies on how data science practice can address these concerns. A typical
data scientist has not enough knowledge for identifying these challenges and it is
not always possible to include an ethics expert during data science production. So,
in this thesis, we provide a practical guideline to data scientists and increase their
awareness. We reviewed different sources of biases and mapped them under different
stages of the data science lifecycle.
<br></br>
More concrete, we have analyzed the data
science pipeline and its stages. There are various different models, but we described
each phase of a specific model using user stories - from the data ingestion phase
to the data analysis phase. For each phase, we analyzed emerging biases and described
them with definitions, examples and best practice. With this knowledge we
then identified a vocabulary to define concepts. After that, we created a supporting
ontology. Therefore, we analyzed existing ontologies and selected specific classes to
create our own ontology on data science and ethics. With our ontology it is possible
to extract knowledge from a specific domain. It is possible to write queries, which for instance extract particular methods for a certain bias. Furthermore it is possible
to analyze and extend different types of biases. As an extension to this, there will
be the possibility to generate a knowledge graph from certain keywords, which for
example indicates for a bias in which phase it can be retrieved, which mitigation
method can be applied, how it relates to other biases and similar. Finally, we have
implemented and analyzed a development tool to support data scientists be aware
of existing biases in the data science lifecycle. With the help of the guiding tool it is
possible to explore all phases of data science and all emerging biases. Furthermore,
data scientists can tag their code with a vocabulary. Finally, the developed tool is
evaluated by computer scientist for its usability and user experience.

										<h2 id="Patent20">Explorative Analysis of a Biomedical Expert Survey to Validate Machine Learning based Patent Classification (2020)</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="images/ame.PNG" class="image fit"><img src="images/ame.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>This project focuses on the data science and analysis of survey data by <a href="https://www.ame.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/nsnq/?lidx=1">AME</a> and is an important basis for an elaborated validation of their machine learning classifier of medical patents.
									</p>
									<p><div><details><summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>
<div align="justify" style="margin-top: 12px;">The <a href="https://www.ame.rwth-aachen.de/go/id/nsnq/?lidx=1">AME</a> conducted a survey with multiple biomedical experts to collect altogether over 1000 ratings on patents to validate the classifier. The goal is to determine the final clear label for a patent, which has multiple ratings of experts with potential differences in expertise for a specific field of the biomedical domain.
The main challenge is to investigate the characteristics of the experts having impact on the ratings.
<br></br>
In this project, we have aggregated the answers of different patent survey participants to find a consistent classification. The average has proven that it provides unexpectedly accurate collective judgements. In this project, the broad approach would be to find weightings from a set of participants to aggregate all opinions into one. This is achieved by evaluating factors that are important for the final result. To find the factors, we have analyzed characteristics of the participants such as self-confidence, expertise or behavioral characteristics, vary them and observe the change. To find these characteristics in our project, I have analyzed the expert survey for different factors.
									<br></br>
									<p><b>Procedure:</b><ul>
										<li>I have analyzed the survey database with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Management_Studio"><i>SQL Server Management Studio</i></a>.</li>
										<li>I have saved important SQL outputs as CSV.</li>
										<li>The diagrams of data are plotted with <a href="https://matplotlib.org/"><i>matplotlib</i></a>. Additionally, I analyzed clusters of data with <i>Python</i>.</li>
										<li>Finally, I have developed an accumulation weighting model with <i>Python</i> and test it against a simple averaging model.</li>

									</header>
									<a href="images/component.PNG" class="image fit"><img src="images/component.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p></p>
									<p>	In a team of four students, we have built a bundle interconnected top level components of a model (let's assume we have a car model with several components which describes driving functions, etc.) into different clusters. The aim is to reduce connection and communication overhead between components by grouping affine components into different clusters which then are connected using a middleware (<a href= "https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>). <p><div><details><summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>
									</p>
									<div align="justify" style="margin-top: 12px;">First of all, we have converted the <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_table">symbol table</a> of a component into an adjacency matrix. Then, we have fed the adjacency matrix into the selected clustering algorithm. The clustering algorithm we used are the following: <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering.html">Spectral clustering</a> and <a href="https://micans.org/mcl/">Markov clustering</a>. We generate middleware tags separating the clusters. This will build the cluster-to-ROS connections. A connection will be established if the target cluster label is different from the source cluster label thus connecting different clusters with each other. Finally, we have fed the result into existing manual clustering architecture.
									Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo simulation</a>, we then generated random costs for the cluster-to-ROS connectgions and compared these with the results of the costs from the adopted clustering algorithms.
									The following diagram shows the Monte Carlo costs for 1000 iterations and 3 cluster formations for the autopilot model.</p>
									<a href="images/montecarlo.png" class="image fit"><img src="images/montecarlo.png" alt="" /></a>
									As expected, the costs were significantly more expensive than those of spectral clustering (1813).

											<h2 id="ego">Hackathon by e.GO Digital (2019)</h2>
										</header>
										<a href="images/ego.PNG" class="image fit"><img src="images/ego.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>The target of the hackathon is the development of approaches for improving station-based carsharing. The given scenario is considered to be a landlord who offers e.Base Home, a carsharing service, to his tenants in a sub-urban neighbourhood. Although it was well received, it turned out that the service was not cost covering due to a low rate of utilization. Due to the landlord's desire to be climate-friendly, not only profitability is to be increased, but emissions are also to be reduced. Other factors to be considered are the improvement of charging behaviour of the users and the intuitive use of the interface. Moreover, an implementation of gamification is expected in order to enhance user engagement.</p>
										<div><details><summary><strong>Procedure</strong></summary>
<div align="justify" style="margin-top: 12px;"> We extended the existing application by two main features: repeated bookings and gamification. We developed our features using Python and for the user interface we additionally employed the framework Kivy. We set up a client-server architecture with "bottle" to simulate a realistic usage environment. The server can use the API to access the database (which includes booking and vehicle information). The other databases such as the ones containing user data and recurring booking information have been hacked together by storing python data types with pickles. The server repeatedly/regularly runs a task to check if the repeating bookings have been added to the booking database and if not, adds the missing bookings. Due to the lack of real data, we generated fictional bookings to prove the feasability of our implementation. The main.py file provides the graphical user interface functionality and uses the functions in the client.py file to communicate with the server.
	The server.py should be started as a background process first and will listen for requests from the client. It uses functions from the control.py and api_control.py files to access the database trough the API.</div>
