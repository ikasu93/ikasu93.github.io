									<h2>About me </h2>
									<p>Hello, my name is Dinh-An Ho and I am 27 years old. I am currently living in Germany and I am studying Computer Science in the Master's program at the 
									<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen University</a>.</p>									
<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/test4.png" alt="" /></span>I was born in Germany and I have always been enthusiastic about mathematical tasks and challenges. That is why I decided to study Computer Science. I am also interested in the technological progress of our time and would like to contribute to the development of digitalization in whatever form (be it as a consultant, as a developer or as an analyst).
My goal is to gain as much experience as possible, to adapt and to help with my knowledge.</p>
<p><blockquote> <i>"I could either watch it happen or be part of it." - Elon Musk</i></blockquote></p>
<p>Besides programming, I spend my free time with painting (especially watercolor and acrylic <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anscolors" class="icon brands fa-instagram"><span class="label"></span></a>) and tactical card games (e.g. Hearthstone). I like to spend my free time with my family and friends, who inspire and motivate me with their passions.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">3D Visualization API for Self-Driving Cars (2017)</h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Screenshot2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p><b>Abstract:</b> In the current, self-driving cars are a huge topic especially because
quality and safety are important factors for humanity. The mortality caused by traffic accidents due to human errors is relatively high.
Research topics revolving around autonomous driving and the technology involved with it have made their appearance, as it has gained in
importance but also in complexity.</p>
									<p>The 3D visualization of research progress is useful so that the software, which controls the autonomous car, can be simulated and tested
in graphical form before using it in a real life scenario. This bachelor thesis deals with the 3D visualization of self-driving cars in web
browsers. The graphical representation of the car behavior helps to
better understand the mechanism of the controller and offers a visual
overview about it. Besides the visualization of the car, it also tackles
the question on how to remotely control a car rendered in a browser.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">An ethics guideline for data scientists (2020)<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/concept_overview.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p><b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, data science has become an indispensable part of our society. Over
time, we have become reliant on this technology because of its opportunity to gain
value and new insights from data in any field - business, socializing, research and
society. The first phase of data science focused on the accuracy and efficiency of
data and its algorithms. The second phase is now based on the growing dependency
- due to convergence of big data, cloud computing, the use of new technologies, such
as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning algorithms, which allows automation
for some tasks with better performance than humans. At the same time, it raises
questions about how justified we are in placing our trust in these technologies.
There is a risk that such powers may lead to biased, inappropriate or unintended
actions. Automated decisions by AI may not be transparent and unfair towards
certain groups. Each step in the data science process (from raw data to insight
and knowledge retrieval) may create bias. Therefore, ethical considerations which
might occur as the result of data science practices should be carefully considered
and these potential problems should be identified during the data science lifecycle
and mitigated if possible. This leads to the area of responsible data science (RDS).
Aspects of RDS centers around data ethics, e.g. achieving fair, consensual, transparent
data which shall provide clarity to data science algorithms. There are some
tools towards data ethics, e.g. ethical codes by the ACM, the IEEE and the ASA
that address data. But these theories have to be embedded in practical approaches.
Although various researchers have raised ethical concerns in AI, there have been
very few studies on how data science practice can address these concerns. A typical
data scientist has not enough knowledge for identifying these challenges and it is
not always possible to include an ethics expert during data science production. So,
in this thesis, we provide a practical guideline to data scientists and increase their
awareness. We reviewed different sources of biases and mapped them under different
stages of the data science lifecycle. More concrete, we have analyzed the data
science pipeline and its stages. There are various different models, but we described
each phase of a specific model using user stories - from the data ingestion phase
to the data analysis phase. For each phase, we analyzed emerging biases and described
them with definitions, examples and best practice. With this knowledge we
then identified a vocabulary to define concepts. After that, we created a supporting
ontology. Therefore, we analyzed existing ontologies and selected specific classes to
create our own ontology on data science and ethics. With our ontology it is possible
to extract knowledge from a specific domain. It is possible to write queries, which for instance extract particular methods for a certain bias. Furthermore it is possible
to analyze and extend different types of biases. As an extension to this, there will
be the possibility to generate a knowledge graph from certain keywords, which for
example indicates for a bias in which phase it can be retrieved, which mitigation
method can be applied, how it relates to other biases and similar. Finally, we have
implemented and analyzed a development tool to support data scientists be aware
of existing biases in the data science lifecycle. With the help of the guiding tool it is
possible to explore all phases of data science and all emerging biases. Furthermore,
data scientists can tag their code with a vocabulary. Finally, the developed tool is
evaluated by computer scientist for its usability and user experience.</p>
